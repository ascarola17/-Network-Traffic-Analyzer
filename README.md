# -Network-Traffic-Analyzer
A tool that captures, analyzes, and visualizes network traffic in real-time or from stored packet capture files (pcap). The tool will provide insights into network activity, identify potential security threats, and help optimize network performance.
Key Features:

Packet Capture: Implement packet capture functionality to capture network traffic from one or more network interfaces.

Traffic Analysis: Analyze captured packets to extract relevant information such as source and destination IP addresses, protocols, packet sizes, and timestamps.

Security Analysis: Implement security analysis features to detect potential security threats such as suspicious network traffic patterns, port scanning, and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.

Performance Monitoring: Provide performance monitoring capabilities to identify bandwidth usage, network latency, and other performance metrics.

Visualization: Develop visualization tools to present network traffic data in a user-friendly and informative manner. This could include graphs, charts, and dashboards.

Alerting: Implement alerting mechanisms to notify administrators of suspicious or anomalous network activity in real-time.
